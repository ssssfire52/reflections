What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	You use the git init command to create a repository which adds a .git folder 
	that holds the metadata for the history and rivision on all the tracked files 
	in your repository.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	The working directory is all the files in the folder where you ran the init 
	command.  The repository contains all the files you told Git to add to it and 
	log the change and revision history.  The working directory is where you place 
	files to be added from the the first to the repository.  I think the staging 
	area is pointless.  Anything that needs to be done in relation to the working 
	directory and staging area could be done with the working directory and the 
	last commit.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

	Use the git diff --staged command to verify the changes between the staging 
	area about to be commit and the last commit.
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

	When trying to implement new features to an existing program that still needs 
	to function.  Like a beta environment where the changes, after being tested 
	get pushed to the main project.
	
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	You can see where each commit thinks it parent is, which can show you if their 
	are unreachable commits.  It would also help with mapping out how you want 
	to organize a large project with many branchs that will needed to get merged 
	later on.
	
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in 
the diagram the way we do?

	The combine changes from two separte branches.  The diagram show the two 
	branches leading to a new commit since this is what happened.
